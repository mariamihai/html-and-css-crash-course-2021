HTML and CSS Crash Course based on DesignCourse's [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-h8L5hgW-w&list=PLT7YlutH3UwUUICVuifz7FZtMb3nZXcRz).

## Tools

Used Live Sass Compiler and Live Server extensions for VSC for the current project.


## Status

**[COMPLETED]** - As I finished the tutorial, I am setting a personal status of "Completed" and will probably not update this repository in the near future as this was a learning project.
